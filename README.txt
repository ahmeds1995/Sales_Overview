I'm happy to share the findings of my first internship task from MeriSkill. 📊
After i received the dataset file from MeriSkill, i opened it in Microsoft Excel and explored the data and the contents of each column. 🔍
I also created a new column "Day Part" to track sales during different periods of the day (Morning - Afternoon - Evening - Midnight).
Then i saved the csv file that contained the clean data, and opened it in power bi desktop to show the findings.
In power bi i created some measures, such as Revenue, Total quantities sold, as well as Total number of products.
📌These are the results that i reached :
1 - Total sales (Revenue) : $34.47M 💰
2 - Total quantities sold 208.812K 🔼
3 - Total products : 19 Products
4 - MacBook Pro labtop is the best-selling product with a total sales of $8,032,500 , followed by the iPhone with a total sales of $4,792,900. 🔝
5 - December 2019 is the best-selling month with a total sales of $4,608,295.70. 🗓
6 - Sales in the afternoon period were the highest with a rate of 36.32% of the total sales, followed by the evening period with a rate of 34.05%. 🕛
